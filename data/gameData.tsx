                curious newcomers and seasoned fans. The main wall stopping people from
                playing souls games I noticed is the difficulty spike. People often have
                described these games as "banging your head against a wall". Elden Ring
                is great because it gives you the freedom to explore and level up
                elsewhere if you get stuck on a boss, giving a shift in the mentality of
                "I have to beat this boss" to "I can come back later when I'm stronger".

                precise and unforgiving, but once you get the hang of it, it's
                incredibly satisfying. Also, the only way to level up your character's
                attack and health is by defeating bosses, so you really have to master
                the combat to progress. This ideology is what makes Sekiro my favorite
                game.
